			"I decided it was time to upgrade my coding skills with some more focused learning. So I enrolled in the online, part-time coding bootcamp: NuCamp. Four months in their full stack course gave me the jump start I needed to start building projects in React which had previously been a technology I really struggle to understand well enough to actually build projects with.",

A few random google searches and youtube recommendations later, I had discovered FreeCodeCamp and from there, it was off to the races. This was truly where my coding journey began to pick up steam. And, in fact, I still use FCC for my web development learning to this day.",

All I cared about was that it was a way to do gaming stuff in school and get away with it. This was during the early days of Game Maker so a good chunk of this code was drag and drop. I didn't learn much about syntax or coding here but it was my first exposure to building actual projects and how fun that could really be. It was also the last time I would do any coding until 2015.",
